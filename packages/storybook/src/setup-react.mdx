# React setup guide

This guide will help you get started with using the Scouterna Design System React
components in your React project.

## Install the packages

You need to install both the Web Components package and the React wrapper
package. The Web Components package is listed as a peer dependency of the React
wrapper package. The versions of both packages should always match to ensure
compatibility:
```bash
pnpm install @scouterna/ui-webc @scouterna/ui-react
```

You also need the Source Sans 3 Variable. The easiest way to include it is to
get it from Fontsource:
```bash
pnpm install @fontsource-variable/source-sans-3
```

## Usage

Before you can use the React components, you need to load the styles and fonts
for the components. This only has to be done once, probably in your main entry
file:
```js
import '@scouterna/ui-webc/style.css';
import "@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3/index.css";
```

Then you can start using the React components in your app:
```js
import { ScoutButton } from '@scouterna/ui-react';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ScoutButton
      variant="primary"
      onScoutClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}
    >
      Click me
    </ScoutButton>
  );
}
```

## Design tokens

The design tokens can be consumed either via CSS variables or through the
Tailwind theme. Which you choose depends on your project setup.

### CSS variables

If you wish to use the design token CSS variables, install the design tokens package:
```bash
pnpm install @scouterna/design-tokens
```

Then import the CSS file somewhere in your project, probably in your main entry
file:
```js
import '@scouterna/design-tokens/tokens.css';
```

This will make the design token CSS variables available globally in your project.

### Tailwind theme
