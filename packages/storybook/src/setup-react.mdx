# React setup guide

This guide will help you get started with using the Scouterna Design System React
components in your React project.

## Install the packages

You need to install both the Web Components package and the React wrapper
package. The Web Components package is listed as a peer dependency of the React
wrapper package. The versions of both packages should always match to ensure
compatibility:
```bash
pnpm install @scouterna/ui-webc @scouterna/ui-react
```

## Usage

Before you can use the React components, you need to load the styles for the
components. This only has to be done once, probably in your main entry file:
```js
import '@scouterna/ui-webc/style.css';
```

Then you can start using the React components in your app:
```js
import { ScoutButton } from '@scouterna/ui-react';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ScoutButton
      variant="primary"
      onScoutClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}
    >
      Click me
    </ScoutButton>
  );
}
```

## Design tokens

The design tokens can be consumed either via CSS variables or through the
Tailwind theme. Which you choose depends on your project setup.

### CSS variables

If you wish to use the design token CSS variables, install the design tokens package:
```bash
pnpm install @scouterna/design-tokens
```

Then import the CSS file somewhere in your project, probably in your main entry
file:
```js
import '@scouterna/design-tokens/tokens.css';
```

This will make the design token CSS variables available globally in your project.

### Tailwind theme
