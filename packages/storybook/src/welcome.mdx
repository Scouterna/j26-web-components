# Scouterna Design System

Welcome to Scouterna's Design System for web applications. It's vaguely based on
[our website](https://www.scouterna.se/)'s design with [our brand
guidelines](https://www.scouterna.se/scout-ledare-kar/kommunicera/grafisk-profil/)
in mind. However, we've also taken a lot of liberties to make it more suitable
for application interfaces.

These components are developed and maintained by [Scouternas
E-tjänster](https://etjanster.scout.se/).

## Flavors

We write our components as [Web
Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) using
[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/). This means you can use them in any web
application, regardless of framework. However, we also provide wrappers for
React. If you need support for another framework that's [supported by
Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview), please [raise an
issue](https://github.com/Scouterna/j26-web-components/issues).
