## Releasing

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage releases and changelogs.

### Creating a Release

1. **Add a changeset**: Run `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompts to describe your changes
2. **Commit the changeset**: The generated changeset file should be committed to your branch
3. **Automated PR creation**: When your changes are merged to main, a release PR will be automatically created
4. **Merge to release**: When the release PR is merged, the following happens automatically:
   - A new version is published to npm
   - The changelog is updated
   - Storybook documentation is built and deployed to GitHub Pages

**Note**: Regular commits do not generate changelog entries. Only changesets create changelog entries.
