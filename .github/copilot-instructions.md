# Copilot Instructions for j26-components

## PR Review Guidelines

### Component Documentation

When reviewing component readme.md files, **DO NOT** suggest adding comments to the props and events tables. These tables are auto-generated from the component source code and should remain comment-free to maintain consistency with the generation process.

Example of tables where comments should NOT be suggested:
- Props tables showing component properties
- Events tables documenting component events

The documentation for these items should be maintained in the source code itself, not in the generated tables.
